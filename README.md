# Sales-Prediction-for-Advertising-Data
Data Analysis on the advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as TV, radio, and newspaper.

In this project, a multiple linear regression model is built using Python. Scikit-learn is used to calculate the regression, while using pandas for data management and seaborn for plotting. The data for this project consists of the very popular Advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as TV, radio, and newspaper. The dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/ishaanv/ISLR-Auto

The key tasks of the project include:
•	Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn
•	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn
•	Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as R² and RMSE
•	Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques
